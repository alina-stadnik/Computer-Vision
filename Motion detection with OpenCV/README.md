Applications:

• Monitoring
• Tracking
• Object recognition (pedestrians)
• Object segmentation
• Counting the number of visitors
• Vehicle counting.

**Background Substraction: Pipeline**


1. Background generation: processing N frames to generate the background image;
2. Background modeling: defining the model that represents the background;
3. Background model update: updating the background model to handle changes occurring over time;
4. Foreground detection: segregating pixels into background or foreground sets.
